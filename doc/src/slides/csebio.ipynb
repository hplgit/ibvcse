      "\n",
      "### Overarching questions\n",
      "\n",
      "* What kind of education do we want to give our undergraduate students and which skills are needed by biology students? \n",
      "\n",
      "* Can we integrate programming, computations, mathematics and topics from physical sciences like physics and chemistry, in a seamless way in the basic biology (including all subdisciplines at IBV) education? \n",
      "\n",
      "* Do we need to teach mathematics, physics, computations, chemistry etc as separate topics/courses, often totally disconnected from the interests and the needs of biology students and their teachers? \n",
      "\n",
      "* Can we teach these topics in such a way that we can develop a better intuition and understanding of say computations and mathematics? And topics from other disciplines as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Would a problem based education suit better the needs of undergraduate programs in biology?\n",
      "\n",
      "* Would it be appropriate to  simply label all courses the first two-years of study as BIO-xxx?  \n",

      "\n",
      "* Set up a team of dedicated teachers (biology and CSE oriented people from other disciplines) and PhD, MSc and undergraduate students that will develop examples of topics to integrate  in biology courses.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* The recently established CINPLA@IBV project (Endringsmiljoe at MN@UiO) has hired four PhD students for four years. These PhD students can as part of their teaching duties develop several examples for biology courses  that integrate math and computations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* The PhD students can form the hard core of the working group, in close collaboration with teachers from IBV and other CSE teachers and MSc and undergraduate students supported by the CSE project.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The duration of the project could be one year, with the final aim to develop a series of cases to present at an education workshop at IBV.\n",
      "\n",
      "* These cases will form the basis for a workshop next year for teachers at IBV, with an emphasis on integrating computations and math. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The exit of this workshop can pave the road for step two, namely developing undergraduate modules that integrate several disciplines in biology courses. \n",

      "\n",

At later stages one can replace these difference equations with differential equations if appropriate and pedagogical relevant. \n",

      " * The equations will also contain parameters which can fitted using the available data. At a later stage one can introduce tools like least-square fitting (this can come later) and let the students write a program which implements this. The necessary understanding of the pertinent statistical analysis and mathematics can then be introduced. \n",

When the predator population is sufficiently high, then the prey population begins dropping. After the prey population falls, then the predator population falls, which allows the prey population to recover and completes one cycle of this interaction. Thus, we see that qualitatively oscillations occur. Can a mathematical model predict this? What causes cycles to slow or speed up? What affects the amplitude of the oscillation or do you expect to see the oscillations damp to a stable equilibrium? The models tend to ignore factors like climate and other complicating factors.
